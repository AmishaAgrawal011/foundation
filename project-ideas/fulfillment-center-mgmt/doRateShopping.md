# doRateShopping

**Purpose:**

Get shipping rates from the Carrier party for the ShipmentMethodTypes configured on the ProductStore and meet the deliveryDays/SLA criteria. 

The doRateShopping service's main objective is to identify the most suitable shipping method for a given shipment by comparing rates from various carriers. 
It takes into account factors such as the shipment's origin and destination, weight, dimensions, desired delivery time, and cost-effectiveness. 
The service seamlessly integrates with a shipping gateway to retrieve real-time rates and then selects the optimal option.

**Detailed Implementation**

1.  **Input and Initialization:**
    *   Shipment
    *   ShipTo address
    *   ShipFrom address
    *   ShipmentPackages

2.  **Shipment and Order Data Retrieval:**

3.  **Shipment Route Segment and Configuration Check:**
    *   Checks if the carrier and shipment method are configured for the product store. 

4.  **Carrier and Shipment Method Selection:**
    *   Gets carriers associated with the origin facility.
    *   For each carrier:
        *   Checks if there's a `CarrierShipmentMethod` entry with delivery days configured.
        *   If so, find methods for the same carrier with delivery days within the configured limit.
        ```
        List<GenericValue> facilityCarriers = EntityQuery.use(delegator).select("partyId").from("FacilityParty").where("facilityId", facilityId, "roleTypeId", "CARRIER").filterByDate().distinct().queryList();

        ```
    
5.  **Rate Comparison and Selection:**
    *   For each qualified carrierShipmentMethod, call the appropriate carrier service to get rates.  
    *   Sort retrieved carrier shipmentMethodRates by estimated cost (ascending).
    *   Selects the cheapest method.

6.  **Return**
    *   Data elements that align with ShipmentPackageRouteSegment entity.  



NOTE:
The in payload is Shipment JSON with all the details needed to get the Shipping label. A Shipment may have one or more Packages. It's possible that the carrier does not support more than one package per shipment. In that case, the get shipping label for each package route sagment. 

I think we should model the input JSON on lines of the Shipment JSON that aggregators like ShipStation will accept.
