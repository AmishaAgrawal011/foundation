# **Fulfillment Application Design Document**

## [Store Fulfillment Lifecycle](https://docs.hotwax.co/documents/v/learn-hotwax-oms/business-process-models/store.fulfillment)


Order fulfillment is 3 step process,
*   Step 1:  * The staff gets the list of [Outstanding orders](https://github.com/hotwax/oms-documentation/blob/user-guides-pub/documents/integrate-with-hotwax/api/fulfillment/apis/outstanding-orders.md). 
  * The user then starts the fulfillment process for set of orders by creating a [Fulfillment wave of orders](createOrderFulfillmentWave.md). A [PickList](PickList.md) is returned for the user to go pick items for preparing the shipments. On success of createOrderFulfillmentWave the OrderItems are tagged "isPicked: Y" in SOLR doc. 
      *  Background process: [Shipments](createShipment.md) are created for orders. 
        *  Based on the inventory allocation rules inventory from a certain location is assigned to [Shipment](/udm/intermediate/Shipment.md), 
        *  A background process is initiated to get shipping labels from the shipping provider.
  *  The user can choose to [rejectOrderItem](rejectOrderItem.md) if for some reason orderItem cannot be fulfilled.
  *  The user can choose to [cancelOrderItem](cancelOrderItem.md) on request of the customer or Customer Service Rep (CSR).

*   Step 2: User completes the [Packing](packShipment.md). Alternatively user can choose to edit autogenerated Shipment.
  *  [rejectShipmentItem](rejectShipmentItem.md).
  *  Add [ShipmentPackage](createShipmentPackage.md)
  *  Move ShipmentItems between packages.
  *  After edits [packShipment](packShipment.md).
  *  [getShippingLabel](getShippingLabel.md).
*   Step 3: User marks Shipment shipped.
  * reprint shipping label and other documents
  * [voidShipmentLabel](voidShipmentLabel.md) and request it again.


### [Shipment lifecycle](ShipmentStatusWorkflow.md)
Shipment is created in SHIPMENT_INPUT, then SHIPMENT_APPROVED to SHIPMENT_PACKED and then SHIPMENT_SHIPPED

* On the SHIPMENT_APPROVED status event of Shipment lifecycle,  systems triggers the process to get Shipping Label (doRateShopping) from the logistics company.
* On successful execution of shipping label RateShopping, the RateShopping service updates the update ShipmentRouteSegment. Set `shipmentMethodTypeId`, `carrierPartyId`, `actualCost`, `carrierServiceStatusId` (SHRSCS_CONFIRMED). 
* Once we have Shipping label, Shipment can be moved to SHIPMENT_PACKED status. 

Modify contents of the Shipment after it is already SHIPMENT_APPROVED or SHIPMENT_PACKED. 

1. If the Approved shipment should be edited, The Shipment is first [reinitializeShipment](reinitializeShipment.md). 
2. In case the Packed shipment should be edited, It is first [Unpacked](unpackOrderItems.md). The Unpacking process moves the shipment to Approved status.
3. If Shipment package contents are modified i.e a Shipment was moved from SHIPMENT_APPROVED status to SHIPMENT_INPUT, ensure to [voidShipmentPackageLabel](voidShipmentPackageLabel.md). Recompute the [ShipmentPackageWeight](calcShipmentPackageTotalWeight.md).

```
    <!-- ShipmentRouteSegment CarrierService status -->
    <StatusType description="ShipmentRouteSegment:CarrierService" hasTable="N"  statusTypeId="SHPRTSG_CS_STATUS"/>
    <StatusItem description="Not Started" sequenceId="01" statusCode="NOT_STARTED" statusId="SHRSCS_NOT_STARTED" statusTypeId="SHPRTSG_CS_STATUS"/>
    <StatusItem description="Confirmed" sequenceId="02" statusCode="CONFIRMED" statusId="SHRSCS_CONFIRMED" statusTypeId="SHPRTSG_CS_STATUS"/>
    <StatusItem description="Accepted" sequenceId="03" statusCode="ACCEPTED" statusId="SHRSCS_ACCEPTED" statusTypeId="SHPRTSG_CS_STATUS"/>
    <StatusItem description="Voided" sequenceId="08" statusCode="VOIDED" statusId="SHRSCS_VOIDED" statusTypeId="SHPRTSG_CS_STATUS"/>
    <StatusValidChange statusId="SHRSCS_NOT_STARTED" statusIdTo="SHRSCS_CONFIRMED" transitionName="Confirm"/>

## HotWax Commerce Shipment 


### [Setting up a New Shipping Carrier](https://github.com/saastechacademy/foundation/blob/main/ofbiz-framework/intermediate/setupShippingCarrier.md)

### Pre-Requisits, NOT included in Fulfillment App. 
1) Setup Faciity with Locations
2) Setup Product and Inventory configurations
3) Import product Inventory
4) Import Orders 
5) Setup Fulfillment user roles and responsibilities.
6) Each Facility has list of Shipping Carriers and may be billing accounts with carrier. 

### Fulfillment App
1) PickList and Picking
2) Shipment lifecycle
3) Shipping Gateway configuration


***Shipping Gateway configuration***
1) [Shipping Carrier](/ofbiz-framework/intermediate/setupShippingCarrier.md)


## UAT

### List of scenarios to test createOrderFulfillmentWave
*   PickList is created, the list of assigned Pickers reconciles with the request
*   The OrderItem count and the PicklistOrderItem record counts reconciles
*   The number of unique shipGroupSeqId reconciles with the number of Shipments created.
*   The number records for each orderId and ShipmentId combination in OrderShipment table reconciles with ShipmentItems

### Ships together scenario
### Digital Goods shipment
### Physical Gift card shipment
### Marketing material and bonus material

### Scenarios 
*   Update shipTo Postal address after shipment is created. The shipping address should be first updated on OrderItemShipGroup and then update the address on Shipment.
  * Update contactMechId on OrderItemShipGroup
  * Update destinationContactMechId on Shipment
  * Update destContactMechId on ShipmentRouteSegment
*   Update shipTo Telecom number after shipment is created. The shipping Telecom should be first updated on OrderItemShipGroup and then update the Telecom on Shipment.
  * Update telecomContactMechId on OrderItemShipGroup
  * Update destinationTelecomNumberId on Shipment
  * Update destTelecomNumberId on ShipmentRouteSegment

## Questions 
1.  Why do we reset carrierPartyId and shipmentMethodTypeId on reinitializeShipment method? Both these fields are HC custom.
2.  What if OrderItemShipGrp has shipment carrier partyId and shipment method set, Do we rate shop or not? What business scenarios are related to this? 
3.  What if during Shipment processing, we may have to get ShippingLabel. In this case we can skip the rate shopping step, Read carrrier Party and shipmentMethodTypeId from the ShipmentRouteSegment entity.
4.  Are we honoring the shipmentMethodType suggested by brokering engine? Brokering engine evaluates distance between fulfillment location and deliver location, if the distance is within the range of ZONE 2, Brokering engine suggests ShipmentMethodType. The Rate shopping process should include the suggested shipmentMethodType.
